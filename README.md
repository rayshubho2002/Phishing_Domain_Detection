# Phishing Domain Detection
Phishing is a prevalent form of cybercrime where attackers impersonate legitimate entities to deceive users into divulging sensitive information. This project focuses on predicting whether domains are real or malicious, using machine learning algorithms and advanced feature engineering techniques.


## Problem Statement
Phishing attacks exploit human psychology, often tricking users into revealing confidential data through deceptive means like fake emails or websites. Our goal is to develop a robust predictive model capable of accurately identifying phishing domains, thereby enhancing online security.

## Approach
We follow a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to tackle the phishing domain detection problem. This includes:

1. Data Exploration: Understand the characteristics of the dataset, uncover patterns, and identify potential challenges.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from different aspects of URLs and content to enrich the predictive power of our model. This includes URL-based, domain-based, page-based, and content-based features.
4. Model Building: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, including but not limited to logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting, to develop an accurate phishing domain detection model.
5. Model Testing: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics and fine-tune them for optimal results.
